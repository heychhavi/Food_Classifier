# Food_Classifier

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a technique within the broader Deep Learning field, have been a revolutionary force in Computer Vision applications, especially in the past half-decade or so. One main use-case is that of image classification, e.g. determining whether a picture is that of a dog or cat.
As an introductory project for myself, I chose to use a pre-trained image classifier that comes with Keras, and retrain it on a dataset that I find interesting.
